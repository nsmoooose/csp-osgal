<h2>OpenSceneGraph Audio Library (osgAL)</h2>
<p>osgAL is a toolkit for handling spatial (3D) sound in the <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OpenSceneGraph</a> 
  rendering library. It utilizes <a href="http://sf.net/projects/alpp">OpenAL++</a> 
  which is an portable object oriented toolkit ontop of <a href="http://www.openal.org">OpenAL</a>. 
  It has been compiled and tested under Windows (.NET2003) and Linux (gcc3.5). 
</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p><a href="html/index.html">API reference</a></p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>osgAL depends on OpenAL++ and OpenSceneGraph. It has been compiled with <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org">OSG 
  0.9.9</a>. Download and build <a href="http://sf.net/projects/alpp">OpenAL++</a> 
  and OSG and install header files and library files where the compiler can find 
  them. </p>
<p>Under Windows, you have 
  to setup the INCLUDE, LIB and PATH path, which can be done with the Environment 
  variables </p>
<p> DOS&gt; set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;c:\tools\openalpp\include<br>
  DOS&gt; set LIB=%LIB%;c:\tools\openalpp\lib<br>
  DOS&gt; set PATH=%PATH%;c:\tools\openalpp\bin</p>
<p> respectively.  
</p>
<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>
<p>There are five main classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SoundManager</li>
  <li>SoundState</li>
  <li>SoundNode</li>
  <li>SoundRoot</li>
  <li>SoundOccluder</li>
</ul>
<h3>SoundState</h3>
<p>A <i>SoundState</i> is 
  a small lightweight class that contains a reference to a <i>osgAL::Sample</i> 
  and the settings for a <i>Sample</i>. This class does nothing more than keeping 
  this <i>Sample</i> and its associated attributes together. It can either have 
  a <i>osgAL::SoundSource</i> (usually a limited resources, 32 or more) associated 
  to it. Sometimes it is necessary to allocate a hardware soundsource to a soundstate, 
  for example looping sounds with ambient sound or music.</p>
<h3>SoundNode</h3>
<p>SoundSource is derived 
  from osg::Node and can be inserted into the scenegraph wherever one wants it 
  to be. During update traversal it will calculate its world position and position 
  the associated SoundState to right orientation and position. No culling is done 
  currently.</p>
<h3>SoundManager</h3>
<p>The SoundManager is responsible 
  for handling queued SoundStates (for sound events described below) and to store 
  all SoundStates to make it possible to find them later on.</p>
<h3>SoundRoot</h3>
<p>A node that during cull 
  traversal updates the SoundManager and updates the transformation for the current 
  listener from the current modelView matrix. This could be done manually, but 
  this node makes it all happen automatically during the cull traversal, which 
  reduces the need of inserting code in the viewer run loop.</p>
<h3>OccludeCallback</h3>
<p>This is a callback class, 
  called during the update of the transformation of the SoundNode. If enabled 
  this callback will shoot a ray from the listener to this SoundNode. If this 
  ray is unoccluded nothing will happen. But if this ray is occluded by some geometry, 
  the gain of the SoundState associated to this node will be reduced by some amount. 
  The functionality of this callback can be extended by inheriting from OccludeCallback 
  and attaching it to the SoundNode.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sound Events</h2>
<p>There is a concept that 
  I call event, for example an explosion is a typical event where a short sound 
  is played once. Another example is the contact sound generated from two colliding 
  objects. When using for example rigid body dynamics, there can be a lot of sound 
  events when objects collides, therefore, the osgAL::SoundManager has a method 
  called <i>pushSoundEvent(osgAL::SoundState *, int priority)</i></p>
<p>This method takes a SoundState 
  as argument. By making a copy of this SoundState (it uses an internal flyweight 
  pattern to avoid creating new SoundStates on the fly) it builds up a queue of 
  SoundStates. Theese SoundStates are played one by one by the SoundManager during 
  its update() call. This makes it possible to have a lot of SoundStates &quot;playing&quot; 
  when there is a real shortage of hardware sound sources (usually 32 or so).</p>
<h2>IO Support</h2>
<p>Thanks to a great contribution of Alberto Jaspe, videaLAB, University of La 
  Coru&ntilde;a (jaspe@udc.es), osgAL now also support IO.<br>
  This is easily tested by running one of the sample application, (i.e. osgal) 
  and press 'o' to save the current scene to a file named saved_model.osg.<br>
  The file saved_model.osg will then also contain the information from osgAL regarding 
  soundnodes, soundstates etc...</p>
<p>This means that scenes containing sound can also be authored through the .osg 
  file format.<br>
  The best documentation for the file format is to look into an existing file, 
  in the /data subdirectory there are a few sample scenes.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>osgal.cpp - Code for testapplication. </p>
<p>osgalmultiple.cpp - Shows dynamic allocation/deallocation of samples.</p>
<p>osgalocclude.cpp - Demonstrates a simple sound occlusion example.</p>
<h4>To run the examples: </h4>
<p>Change directory to the 
  data sub-directory that contains the bee.wav sample file (<i>data</i>). Start 
  the test application with osgal (make sure you have the path to the dynamic 
  libraries (OSG, Producer, OpenThreads, OpenAL++ and osgAL).</p>
<h4>Keybindings</h4>
<i>space</i> - Pushes a SoundState 
as an Event (non-looping). Results in a sound that plays once at the position 
of the listener. Pressing it repeatedly will add even more SoundStates...  
<p>The examples demonstrates 
  the basic functionality of the OSGAL toolkit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating an osgal::Sample 
    (which holds the .wav sample file)</li>
  <li>Creating an osgAL::SoundState 
    (which holds a Sample and settings)</li>
  <li>Creating an osgAL::SoundNode 
    (which holds a SoundState) and attaching it to a transformation node to make 
    it move.</li>
  <li>Creating an osgAL::SoundRoot 
    (which updates the SoundManager and the transformation of the listener according 
    to the modelViewMatrix).</li>
  <li>Accessing the osgAL::SoundManager 
    to add SoundStates and pushing SoundStates as events.</li>
  <li>Handling occlusions 
    of geometry in the scene</li>
</ul>
