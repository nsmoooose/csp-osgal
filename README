OpenSceneGraph Audio Library - OsgAL is a small library for adding 3D sound support to the
open source scenegraph OpenSceneGraph.

By adding a SoundNode to the scene a sound can be made following the transformation of the parents.

Build under linux:

./autogen.sh
make

Build under windows:
Due to missing version information in the OpenAL header files,
a macro named OPENAL_VERSION was introduced.
Under unix, this is managed automatically from the content of the
OpenAL header files (in configure.in).
Unfortunately there is no such mechanism in windows.
Therefore the OpenAL version has to be determined manually (check configure.in)
and set in include/openalpp/windowsstuff

Default is OPENAL_VERSION == 2007 (latest).

To build: see howtobuild_vs2003.bat

Currently there are project files for VC6 (.dsw/.dsp), Visual Studio .NET2003 (VC7) (*-vc7.vcproj/*-vc7.sln)
and finally for VisualStudio 2005 (VC8).
The latter is what is going to be supported in the future. We are dropping the older versions
one by one. So some things might not go into the older project files.

There are prebuild libraries for ogg-vorbis at http://www.vrlab.umu.se/research/osgAL
